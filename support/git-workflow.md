# A quick start for git workflow
After forking the repository from the github website, you will have your own copy of the original repository `c-programming`, user `git clone` with the link from your forked repository to bring it in your local machine. e.g (`git clone https://github.com/MostafaMamouni/c-programming`).

Now, you can edit your files inside the repository. And then you can follow their changes by `git status` and commit the changes by `git commit -m "your commit message"`, and then `git push` (if it's the fist push you can user `git push --set-upstream origin branch_name`) to submit your work to your github repository.
